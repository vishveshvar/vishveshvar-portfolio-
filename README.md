#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more info.

#### `npm run build`

It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.
